## Amenhotep Prince Ndombo - Emoji Project Writen Reflection

This project was focused on designing and creating a custom emoji, with the goal to display personal identity and creativity. I chose to create an emoji of a smiley face with a blue star directly behind it because it reflects my optimistic personality and my drive to shine. The smiley face represents positivity and happiness, and the blue star symbolizes excellence, ambition, and uniqueness. This project contributed to my learning experience by helping my creative skills, giving me experience with digital design tools and deepening my understanding of python.  The process strengthened my problem solving abilities, teaching me flexibility and openness to feedback. Before, I imagined a simple smiling face, but through trial and error, I added the blue star to give the design more personality since a smiley face is mostly basic on it's own. Looking back, I would experiment more with color palettes and shading techniques and explore different possibilities and convey more emotion. If I were to further develop this project, I would animate the emoji to add playfulness, like having the smiley face change expressions, and learn more techniques to enhance the detail, making the emoji more unique and polished.
