A common misconception that someone might have when completeing this assignment that when it refers to the internet, you have to think about things in a broader spectrum rather than being confined to your own thoughts. When I say this, I mean that people aren't viewing the internet as this expansive collection but are simply confining to how fast they can open their broswer when it's so much more than that.
