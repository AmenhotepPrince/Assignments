Practice Set 9 - Fault Tolerance

Questions I got wrong: Q9

## Q9: Remove network connections so A cannot contact F
I believe I got this question wrong because I believed that I had to cut off all routes from the source, A, instead of simply stop all connections from being able to reach F, which ultimately only came down to lines CF and HF.
