Checkpoint 1 - Introduction to the Internet
Questions I got wrong: Q5, Q8

## Q5: The Internet and the WWW
 I confused myself on this question by thinking the Internet and the World Wide Web were teh same thing, which could've been why I picked D, instead of teh right answer, C.

## Q8: True Statements About The Internet
I accidentally picked B instead of D on this one because I didn't carefully read and understand teh question itself.
