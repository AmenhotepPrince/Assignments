U1 CP1 Introduction to the Internet

Questions I got wrong: Q5, Q8

## Q5: The Internet and the WWW
I got this wrong because I didn't understand the clear difference between the World wide Web and the Internet, and beacuse of theat ignorance I decided to go with answer D because the names sounded like they were referring to the same thing.

## Q8: True statements About The Internet
I got this question wrong because although I got answer C right, I got B wrong because I thought the IETF managed the entire internet, when in reality, nobody has full owner or control over the cyberspace.
