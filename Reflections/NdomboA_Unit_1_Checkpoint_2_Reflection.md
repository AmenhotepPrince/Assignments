U1 CP2 Fault Tolerance and Parallel/Distributed Computing

Questions I got wrong: Q4, Q5, Q6

## Q4: Network Analysis, Pt 1
I got this wrong because I didn't know if I should reconnect the existing lines left after removing one of the devices.

## Q5: Network Analysis, Pt 2
I made the same mistake on this question because I didn't properly understand the difference between "not being routed through the same device more than one time" so I thought that it meant I couldn't use any of the same devices I used for one route for another.

## Q6: Network Analysis, Pt 3
I got this question wrong simply because I didn't know if I had to find more than one route to consider something true or not, which was really just a comprehension mistake on my part.
